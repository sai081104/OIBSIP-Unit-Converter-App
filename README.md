# 📐 Unit Converter App

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple Android app I built during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. It lets you convert between a few basic units — nothing too fancy, just clean and functional!

You can convert between:

- Centimeters ↔ Meters  
- Meters ↔ Centimeters

Just type a number, choose what you want to convert, and boom — done!
